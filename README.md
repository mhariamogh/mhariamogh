## Hi there 👋

I am a product designer with a background in CS and HCI. I am currently at Norton helping launch privacy-focused products for millions of users. I am both data-driven and intuition-led. I enjoy hiking, photography, running and CrossFit. Lately, I've been into learning coding to bring my ideas to life.
