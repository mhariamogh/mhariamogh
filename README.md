## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a product designer with a background in CS and HCI. I am currently at Norton helping launch privacy-focused products for millions of users. I am both data-driven and intuition-led. I enjoy hiking, photography, running, and CrossFit. Lately, I've been bringing my ideas to life with the help of AI.
